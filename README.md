Types for working with Twitter's API.

This is a copy of the Haskell library
[twitter-types](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/twitter-types).

This has been abandoned.  However, it should be mostly working.  There are a few [outstanding issues](https://github.com/cdepillabout/purescript-twitter-types/issues) that need resolving before it can be used.
